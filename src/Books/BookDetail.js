        description: 'Rich Dad Poor Dad is a book on personal finance and investing by Robert Kiyosaki. It advocates the importance of financial literacy, financial independence, and building wealth through investing in assets, real estate, and starting and owning businesses. The book contrasts Kiyosaki\'s two "dads," his real father - the poor dad, and his best friend\'s father - the rich dad, and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. Rich Dad Poor Dad will explode the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich, and show parents why they can\'t rely on the school system to teach their kids about money.',
